## Purpose

My art is dedicated to fostering an appreciation of cultural diversity. My quest to preserve the vanishing peoples of the earth in collages, etchings and watercolors has taken me ...

... from Rajasthan, a former princely state of India, to Lamu, a Swahili island in the Indian Ocean ...

... from trekking with gypsies in the Himalayas, to pounding fou fou in a West African market ...

... from Ladakh, India’s “Little Tibet”, to Lake Dal, the “Venice of Kashmir” ...

... from singing and dancing with the Samburu of Kenya, to exploring the island of St. Eustatius in the West Indies.

My adventuresome spirit took me away to the Chalbi desert in Kenya to sketch the beautiful Gabra tribe and their caravans of camels. Living with them provided a tapestry of life which weaves through all of my work.

My rich and colorful paintings act as an ethnologist's record of primitive and traditional life. I focus on populations that consciously resist westernization, that still live in harmony with their environment and value their traditional dress and customs.

I have found many Shangri-Las. I have tried to capture the unique beauty, the vivid color, the movement and moods that make the nobility of each individual culture stand out. The simple dignity of mankind stimulates me to share my impressions visually.
